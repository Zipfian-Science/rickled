--------------------------

* Adding ability to load list (array) instead of dict (object), opening way for lists of configs.
* New list type internal representation "array".
* Added new ``put`` method for putting values in Rickle with any path. Where the path does not exist, the path will be created.
* Changed ``set`` to only mutate paths that already exist. Creating clear distinction between set and put.
* Added multi document YAML support.
* Added JSONL support.

Version 1.2.2 (2025-02-17)
--------------------------

* Rename of entire project from ``rickled`` to ``rickle``!
* Fixed bug in CLI tool not able to run
* Made ``provider_access_key`` optional for ``secret`` type.

Version 1.2.1 (2025-02-12)
--------------------------

* Major additions and changes, bumped version to ``1.5.0``.
* Init args now parsed with opening braces ``{{`` and closing braces ``}}``.

* Added optional INI support.
* Added optional .ENV support if extras installed ``pip install rickled[dotenv]``.
* Added optional XML support if extras installed ``pip install rickled[xml]``.
* Renamed optional extras for twisted, now installed ``pip install rickled[net]``.
* With added ability to use XML, keys are now cleansed of non alphabetic characters, but kept for serialisation.
* Added more customisation. Path separator can now be define with init arg ``RICKLE_PATH_SEP`` or environment variable ``RICKLE_PATH_SEP``.
* Added list type index getter to paths, for example ``/path/to/a_list[0]`` returns first element (if ``a_list`` is of list type)
* Added static method ``flatten_dict`` to squash a Python dictionary into a thin dictionary with depth of 1.
* Undo the flattening of a dictionary with static method ``inflate_dict``.
* Now able to dump to INI file or string using ``to_ini``.
* When reading INI, dictionaries are automatically inflated, split on ``RICKLE_INI_PATH_SEP`` env var or init arg.
* Furthermore, ``RICKLE_INI_OPENING_BRACES`` and ``RICKLE_INI_CLOSING_BRACES`` can be set with env var or init arg.
* Removed unsafe code and usage into separate class, ``UnsafeRickle``.
* Added optional schema validator if extras installed (only for Python>3.8) ``pip install rickled[validators]``.
* Adding ability to pipe into CLI tool, i.e. perform ``cat file.json | rickle conv -x json -t yaml``.

* Deprecating ``add_csv_file`` for ``add_csv``.
* Deprecating ``add_from_file`` for ``add_from``.
* Deprecating ``add_api_json_call`` for ``add_api_json``.
* Deprecating ``add_attr`` for ``add``.
* New init arg ``RICKLE_NAME_CLEAN_UP`` to skip cleaning key names of disallowed chars.
* Fixed logical flaw in ``dict`` where cleaned up keys not being used.
* Added helper mapping ``get_native_type_name`` to map Python type names to format native names.
* Renamed schema types to conform more to JSON schema, i.e. ``dict`` becomes ``object``, ``list`` becomes ``array`` etc.
* Added ``min`` and ``max`` to array type in schema validation.
* Added ability to use ``jsonschema`` instead in ``Schema.schema_validation`` by setting ``use_json_schema=True`` if jsonschema is installed.
* Added ``--extras`` to schema generation to add things like "required" etc.
* Renamed ``schema`` to ``properties`` for objects in default rickle schema.
* Renamed ``schema`` to ``items`` for objects in default rickle schema.
* Added ``add_secret`` to Rickle, now able to add secrets from cloud providers ``aws``, ``google``, ``azure``.
